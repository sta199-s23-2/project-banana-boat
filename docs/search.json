    "text": "This data set comes from the CORGIS Dataset Project, which got this data from the US Energy Information Administration, a part of the US Government. This data has been collected by the US Energy Information Administration from 1960 to 2019 based on the consumption, production, expenditures, and price of different sources of energy by state.\nThe observations are of different states in different years and have variables for many energy sources, including coal, kerosene, geothermal, hydro, etc. There are also different variables for the production, consumption, expenditure, and price of these types of energy. For some of these, information was not available, in which case a 0 was reported.\nThere should be no ethical concerns about the data since the data is not specific to individuals and reports many types of used energy in the US.\nResearch question: On both a regional and national level, how has the proportion of renewable energy consumption relative to overall energy consumption changed over time, and has this shift been because of geographic, political, or other external factors?\nAs climate change continues to progress rapidly, it is important to move towards clean technology and renewable energy sources in order to save our earth while ensuring innovation. The United States of America has emerged as a leading renewable energy innovator in the world, which is a perfect study target for researchers who are interested in the implementation of renewable energy. Our team thinks that analyzing the energy usage of different states is a good way to see how our country is progressing toward the goal of slowing global warming on a local level. This research method will help policymakers and environmental engineers pinpoint the specific problems regarding renewable energy in our country and help us move towards a clean future of collaboration of all states.\nImportant definitions: The data set contains both categorical and quantitative variables. The categorical variables include “State”. The remaining columns, focusing on relevant facts regarding different uses of energy, are all quantitative.\nRenewable energy: For our project, energy is considered renewable if it meets two criteria. First, the energy must be derived from a naturally occurring source. Additionally, the energy is naturally replenished at a higher rate than it is consumed/used.\nOther energy sources: natural gas, coal, as well as any other sources of energy.\nGroups of interest: states, regions, political parties, expenditures and consumption of renewable energy and other energy sources. Our goal is to study the effects of these aforementioned variables to learn about consumption habits and the technological specialization of different states."

    "text": "Results\nOur data confirms several important pieces of information about renewable energy usage in the United States. The first is that on a national level, we expect the proportion of renewable energy to continue increasing each year, with a predicted 2030 proportion of 0.0015. However, with that being said we also calculated a low adjusted r-squared value of 0.46, showing a low correlation between a rising proportion of renewable energy and year. This proportion of 0.0015 is very low for the amount of total energy in the US that is renewable. While it is continually increasing, it is increasing very slowly. Therefore, this further proves that big changes need to be made in the use of renewable energy in the United States if we want to slow or stop climate change.\nAdditionally, on regional levels, we’ve predicted that the NE will have the highest proportion of renewable energy in the year 2030 at 0.0023, compared to the lowest region, the south, which is predicted to be at 0.00033. Yet, once again, our adjusted r-squared value of 0.09 shows that our estimation is only that, and there is significantly low correlation between the proportion of renewable energy versus year and region, even less than on a national level. Even though this model has a low R squared, there is correlation between region and renewable energy usage. This is most likely a cause of cultural factors in these different regions. These cultural differences manifest because of differing beliefs about climate change as well as different economies and areas of employment. Another factor to consider when looking at regions is accessibility to renewable energy. However, since the Midwest is the region that produces the most renewable energy, but it only has the third-highest proportion of renewable energy, it is unlikely that this is a large factor in the usage of renewable energy.\nLastly, when we divided the states based on political affiliation, we found that states who are democratic overall had a higher proportion of renewable energy usage than Republican states and are increasing at a faster rate as well. However, we found an adjusted r-squared of -0.0004, showing that there is a very high level of variability that cannot be explained by this model. Therefore, while policy based on party likely has an effect, there are many other variables at play to explain the usage of renewable energy."

    "text": "This project looks at the use of renewable energy in the United States in order to analyze trends in hopes of informing change that can help slow climate change. We used the data, which looks at different types of consumption and expenditure of each state, to compare the proportion of renewable energy usage nationally, regionally, and politically. Overall, we found that the use of renewable nationally is both low and only increasing slightly, but still not nearly enough to slow climate change. By region, our findings show that the Northeast has the highest use of renewable energy, while the South has the lowest. Additionally, by political party, we found that Democratic states use more renewable energy than Republican states. However, overall we found that each of these groupings was not a sufficient way to explain the trends in the proportion of renewable energy usage, as evidenced in our models’ low adjusted r-squared values, as there are countless other interacting factors, shown by the high AIC on our models, including current events, economics, resource access, and population, all of which were limitations to our data set."

The article makes the claim that natural gas and renewable energy consumption has increased, oil and nuclear power consumption didn’t change and coal decreased. In the 21st century, renewable energy consumption has almost doubled, making its increasing importance obvious. Despite this, renewable energy still only makes up 11% of U.S. energy consumption.\nIn 1-2 sentences, explain how your research question builds on / is different than the article you have cited.

Our group found the “Graduates” data set from the CORGIS - Collection of Really Great, Interesting, Situated - Dataset Project by Austin Cory Bart of Virginia Tech University.\nState when and how it was originally collected (by the original data curator, not necessarily how you found the data). This data set was originally conducted by the National Survey of Recent College Graduates from 1973 through 2010, providing demographic and career information about individuals holding a bachelor’s or master’s degree in science, engineering, or health field from an academic institution in America. This study was a cross-sectional biennial survey that sampled United States residents who received their degree in the prior 2 or 3 academic years and were under age 76.\nWrite a brief description of the observations. Each observation in this data set represents each college graduate who satisfies the aforementioned conditions, with information about their age, citizenship status, educational history, as well as other variables related to their work, family, and salary.\nAddress ethical concerns about the data, if any. First, because the information about each survey participant is personal, we have to keep them confidential and solely for the purpose of this study. Specifically, sensitive data such as salary and place of birth should not be shared publicly. Second, although we, as researchers, are working to find meaningful correlations purely from data, it is important to keep in mind the humanity aspect of this project, as the data represents people who come from multicultural backgrounds. Last but not least, researchers should be aware of the potential bias given by the data set, as it does not necessarily reflect what is truly going on in the workplace because of different factors such as non-response from survey takers."

    "text": "Research question\n\nA well formulated research question. (You may include more than one research question if you want to receive feedback on different ideas for your project. However, one per data set is required.) With an interest in how policy, jobs, and different aspects of society change during times of hardships, our group wants to analyze the effects of the Great Recession from late 2007 to 2009 on the job market in the United States. In particular, we are interested to see which majors and degree types had the highest employment rate, the change in salaries level of each major during the recession, which ethnicity groups were able to stay in the workplace and which were laid off, and the percentage of people who had to work outside of their majors during college because of the recession. All in all, these mini questions serve to answer our research interest: “How did the Great Recession affect the labor market for United States college graduates from 1973 through 2010?” Listed below are the embedded questions within this research project:\nWithin U.S. college graduates from 1973 to 2010, which majors and degree types had the highest employment rate during the Great Recession?\n\nHow much did the salaries level of U.S. college graduates from 1973 to 2010 change during the Great Recession?\nWhich ethnic groups of U.S. college graduates from 1973 to 2010 had the highest laid-off percentage during the Great Recession?\n\nWhat was the percentage of U.S. college graduates who worked outside of their majors or degrees during the Great Recession?\n\n\nA description of the research topic along with a concise statement of your hypotheses on this topic. Humanity has survived and grown more resilience through many challenges in history - the Spanish Flu, the Great Depression, the World Wars - and the Great Recession of 2008 is not an exception. Analyzing how people reacted to these challenges with resilience and grit will inform historians, policy makers, and anthropologists with human tendency and societal structures. Furthermore, this kind of study will give us the lessons of history to not repeat these same mistakes in the future. College students can also learn about different trends in the economy that will advise them about the degrees and majors to pursue in their post-secondary journey. On a different note, research questions on the effects of one’s ethnicity in the job market will reveal discriminatory patterns in the United States against marginalized groups.\n\nOur team will base our studies on variables related to majors, salaries, demographics, and employment status across the time frame of 2007 to 2009. In particular, the variables and their types we will be using are:\n\nEducation.Major: String\nSalaries.Median: Float\nDemographics.Ethnicity.Asians, Demographics.Ethnicity.Minorities, Demographics.Ethnicity.Whites, Demographics.Gender.Male, Demographics.Gender.Female: Integer\nEmployment.Reason Working Outside Field: Integer\n\nOur hope is to derive meaningful relationships within these variables depending on the aforementioned research questions. Some of my hypotheses include:\n\nScience-related majors will have the highest employment rate during this time in the country.\nThe overall salaries level of U.S. workers fell dramatically as the economy entered the Great Recession.\nMinorities groups such as Asians, Hispanics, African Americans, and females will be laid off more than other groups.\nMore college graduates would have to pivot and enter an industry that had more demand than the one they majored in.\nIdentify the types of variables in your research question. Categorical? Quantitative? The majority of variables in this data set and the research questions are quantitative, which include the number of degrees, the amount of people unemployed, graduates working in academic research, and so on. The only categorical variable is the major of each college graduate."

Who suffers during recessions? NBER. Retrieved March 9, 2023, from (https://www.nber.org/papers/w17951)\nProvide a one paragraph summary about the article. The authors of this article found that the impacts of the Great Recession caused by the crash in the real estate market from 2007 to 2009 have been greater for men, for black and Hispanic workers, for young workers, and for less educated workers than for others in the labor market. The researchers identified a common theme among recessions in the past 30 years, indicating that even though dramatic changes, including the increase of women in the labor force, were happening, the pattern of unemployment remained stable. A reason for this phenomenon is because men are more often employed in highly cyclical industries. The researchers concluded that the groups who lost in the recessions of the 1980s are the same people who experience weaker labor market outcomes even in good times. Thus, the labor market effects of the Great Recession were different from those of business cycles over the three previous decades in size and length, but not in type.\nIn 1-2 sentences, explain how your research question builds on / is different than the article you have cited. Our research questions delve deeper into the matter of which groups are being affected the most by recessions as we study different ethnic groups and graduates with various majors and degree types, which add on to the aforementioned research on the effects of recessions on men and women. Our research will help further inform the inequalities and unemployment patterns in the labor market in the United States and incentivize policymakers to enact meaningful changes to help the most harmed demographics during recessions."

Overall, the observations are meant to paint a detailed picture of each crime and include the necessary facts to best understand what happened.\nAddress ethical concerns about the data, if any. When working with data as sensitive as crime, it is important to remember that these numbers and observations represent real crimes that occurred which had impacts on real people. The ethical concern here is to balance a high level of analysis of the data with also remembering that these are not simply numbers on a page, but rather real people who were affected. The data should be taken seriously, and a level of care with the data should be taken that remains respectful."

    "text": "Research question\n\nA well formulated research question. (You may include more than one research question if you want to receive feedback on different ideas for your project. However, one per data set is required.) For our research question, we want to look at how the pandemic impacted crime in the Los Angeles area in a number of areas, including crime frequency, the severity of the crime committed/type of crime, and what the demographics committing the crime were (age, sex, race). That is all to answer the question: How did the COVID-19 pandemic affect the crime situation in Los Angeles, particularly regarding crime frequency, severity, type, and demographics?\nA description of the research topic along with a concise statement of your hypotheses on this topic. This is an important question, especially now, because as the pandemic has lingered in our life for years now, we have been slowly transitioning out of the pandemic lifestyle. More and more COVID protocols are being stripped away, and society is returning to more normalcy every week, so as we make the switch, it will be interesting to see how the onset of the pandemic affected crime. It has been so long since we lived in a fully non-pandemic world, so investigating how it affected society’s behavior, especially in a way as important and extreme as crime, holds a lot of significance in how we adjusted into the current world we know, and how we will react coming out of it. The larger topic here is human behavior and reaction, which we are looking at through crime statistics before and after the onset of the COVID pandemic. We want to look at key factors such as how crime tendencies may have shifted, as well as overall if there was a shift in the amount of crime committed. My hypothesis is that the start of the pandemic likely decreased crime, as well as greatly altered the types of crimes being committed. With businesses shut down, and people much more likely to simply stay home, I believe it was harder to commit crimes. Additionally, the type of crime committed likely changed to be more geared towards the at-home protocols, meaning that there was likely significantly less interpersonal crime amongst strangers.\nIdentify the types of variables in your research question. Categorical? Quantitative? In our data set, we are looking at both categorical as well as quantitative variables. Quantitatively, we want to look at the comparison of pre-pandemic versus pandemic crime numbers. Categorically, we also want to go more in-depth and see what the profile of the crimes being committed was."

Los Angeles burglary and COVID-19 restrictions. J Exp Criminol (2022). (https://doi.org/10.1007/s11292-022-09522-0)\nProvide a one paragraph summary about the article.\n\nThe objective of this article was to analyze burglary in Los Angeles based on COVID-19 restrictions. The study found that COVID-19 restrictions significantly increased burglary in industrial areas, but decreased burglary in residential areas. The study attributed the increase in crime to the decrease in capable guardianship as COVID-19 restrictions were placed. Capable guardianship is anything that discourages crime from taking place such as alarm systems or security in stores. Therefore, it is clear that as capable guardianship decreases, crime increases. However, the study did not give an explanation on why capable guardianship decreased with COVID-19 restrictions. The study also supports routine activity theory, which states that crime occurs when there is a motivated offender, a suitable target, and a lack of capable guardianship. Thus, when white collar professionals transitioned to working at home, there was a lack of suitable targets in residential areas. However, low income and essential workers continued to work in industrial areas, providing suitable targets for crime, which is why there was more crime in industrial areas compared to residential areas.\n\nIn 1-2 sentences, explain how your research question builds on / is different than the article you have cited. Our research question is different from this study because it analyzes all different crimes during a certain period, which is not restricted to just burglary. In addition, we will look at many other factors including sex, severity of the crime, race, age, etc."

U.S. Energy in the 21st Century: A Primer. The Congressional Research Service. Retrieved March 10, 2023, from https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/R/R46723.\nThis article dives into energy usage in the United States and goes into detail about recent trends. The text claims that, despite energy consumption remaining relatively constant, the U.S. has shifted away from non-renewable energy sources (oil and coal) and towards more renewable sources of energy. The article makes the claim that natural gas and renewable energy consumption has increased, oil and nuclear power consumption didn’t change and coal decreased. In the 21st century, renewable energy consumption has almost doubled, making its increasing importance obvious. Despite this, renewable energy still only makes up 11% of U.S. energy consumption.\nOne big difference between our data and the article that we want to expand upon is that the article talks about general trends in the U.S., but doesn’t discuss any of the costs. Also, the article doesn’t take into account the factors that could provide reasoning for differences in renewable energy usage such as region or political affiliation, which we looked into."

    "text": "Discussion\nA big takeaway from our models is that the regional AIC came out to be -16,233.92, while the political affiliation AIC came out to -16038.41, showing that there are a lot of other factors not present in our data set which need to be taken into account and can better explain a correlation to the proportion of renewable energy. Even on a national level, using time as a predictor of the proportion of renewable energy resulted in an AIC of -788.18, so overall the models we have do not represent a meaningful connection to the proportion. This can be summed up to some of the limitations of our data set, with the first being its lack of data on a smaller scope. The information it contains does not go beyond a state level, and we believe that local factors such as resources, energy rates, and metropolitan population can better explain the choice to use renewable energy. Additionally, current events which could potentially affect the energy market and decision-making about energy sources are also not included in the data set, which we believe is another significant factor left out. These have manifested in many different ways since 1960, including oil crises, economic crises, and job availability. All of these factors and many more create a huge amount of variability in this data set, making it difficult to predict the future usage of renewable energy.\nOverall, there is not one factor we can look at in order to improve renewable energy usage, instead, we need to look at climate change as a whole. If we can increase the amount of education and discourse about climate change, we can hope to bring it into the forefront of people’s minds. That way they will consider the effects of everything they do economically, politically, and in their personal lives on the effect on the climate. It is imperative that we work towards a higher national usage of renewable energy at every level in order to save our planet."
